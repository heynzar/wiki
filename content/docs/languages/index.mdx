# Programming Languages

A Journey of Learning, Mastery, and Sharing

Welcome to the **Programming Languages** Corner of this Wiki. A simple, friendly place where I document my journey of understanding how software really works.

---

## The Two Main Sections of This Category

### 1. Languages

This is where I cover the programming languages I'm learning, not 'quick notes', but real understanding.  
Expect explanations, diagrams, cheat-sheets, examples, and all the important details that matter in real development.

Current languages in focus:

- **Java**: disciplined, structured, perfect for real engineering foundations
- **JavaScript**: the heart of the web
- **TypeScript**: safer, cleaner, powerful typing
- **Python**: simple, fast, amazing for automation and AI
- **SQL**: the language of data

More languages may join as the journey grows.

### 2. Concepts

Programming languages are built on ideas, and if you understand the ideas, learning languages becomes 10x easier.

Here are all the essential concepts you'll find in this wiki:

- **Programming Paradigms**: OOP, Functional, Procedural, Declarative, and more.
- **Type Systems**: How languages handle and enforce data types.
- **Syntax & Semantics**: The rules and meaning behind code instructions.
- **Memory & Runtime**: How programs store data and execute internally.
- **Compilation & Execution Models**: How code transforms into something runnable.
- **Data Structures & Built-In Types**: Core containers and primitive language types.
- **Control Flow**: How programs make decisions and repeat actions.
- **Functions, Methods & Modules**: Organizing logic into reusable code components.
- **Error Handling & Exceptions**: Managing failures and unexpected program behavior.
- **Concurrency & Multithreading**: Running multiple tasks efficiently and safely.
- **Standard Libraries & APIs**: Built-in tools every language provides by default.
- **Design Principles & Best Practices**: Writing clean, maintainable, scalable software systems.
- **Language Philosophies**: Why languages feel different and act differently.
- **Ecosystem & Tooling**: Tools that support building, testing, and managing code.

These are the foundations of thinking like an engineer! Not just writing code.

## The Goal

This category is the roadmap of my learning path and a resource for anyone who shares the same passion.  
Friendly, simple, and focused on real understanding.

Let's learn, master, and share together.  
The journey starts here.
